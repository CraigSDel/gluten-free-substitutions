# GitHub Repository Setup

## Manual GitHub Repository Creation

Since the GitHub CLI is not available, please follow these steps to create the repository and push the code:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `gluten-free-substitutions`
5. Description: `A privacy-first web application that helps users convert regular recipes to gluten-free versions with accurate ingredient substitutions`
6. Set to **Public**
7. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in the project directory:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gluten-free-substitutions.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
5. The deployment will happen automatically when you push to the main branch

### 4. Verify Deployment

The website will be available at:
`https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/gluten-free-substitutions`
